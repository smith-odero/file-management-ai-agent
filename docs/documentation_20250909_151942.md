# File Management AI Agent Documentation

## 1. Purpose and Overview

This Jupyter Notebook (`file-management-ai-agent.ipynb`) implements a file management AI agent using Google's Gemini API.  The agent interacts with a user, receiving commands related to file manipulation (listing, reading, writing, deleting, updating) and documentation generation.  It utilizes a system of helper functions, AI-driven response processing, and a main agent loop to execute these commands. The agent stores its conversation history in memory and can handle multiple user requests within a limited number of iterations.

## 2. Key Components/Functions

The notebook is structured into several key cells, each responsible for a specific aspect of the agent's functionality:

* **Environment Setup:** Loads environment variables (including the Google API key) from a `.env` file and configures the Gemini API.

* **Helper Functions:**  Provides core file manipulation functions:
    * `list_files()`: Lists all files in the current directory.
    * `read_file(file_name: str)`: Reads the content of a specified file. Returns an error message if the file is not found.
    * `write_file(file_name: str, content: str)`: Writes content to a file. Returns success or error message.
    * `delete_file(file_name: str)`: Deletes a specified file. Returns success or error message.
    * `update_file(file_name: str, content: str)`: Appends content to a file. Returns success or error message.
    * `create_docs_directory()`: Creates a 'docs' directory if it doesn't already exist.

* **AI Response Processing:**  Handles communication with the Gemini API:
    * `extract_markdown_block(text: str, block_type: str)`: Extracts specific content (e.g., JSON action block) from the Gemini response.
    * `generate_response(prompt: str)`: Sends a prompt to the Gemini API and returns the response text.
    * `parse_action(response: str)`: Parses the Gemini response into a dictionary containing the `tool_name` and `args` for the requested action.

* **Agent Configuration:** Defines the agent's memory, iteration limits, and system rules.  The `agent_rules` list contains instructions for the Gemini model on how to format its responses and what tools are available.

* **Advanced Tool Functions:**  Provides more complex functionalities:
    * `generate_documentation(file_names: list)`: Reads specified files, uses the Gemini API to generate markdown documentation, and saves it to the 'docs' directory.

* **Main Agent Loop:**  The core of the agent, continuously prompting for user input, sending prompts to Gemini, parsing responses, executing actions, and updating the memory.  Includes error handling and mechanisms to gracefully stop the agent.

    * `run_agent()`: Manages the overall agent loop.
    * `execute_action(action: dict)`: Executes the action specified by the parsed Gemini response.

* **Testing Functions (Optional):** Provides example calls for testing individual functions.

## 3. Usage Examples

The agent is designed to be interactive.  After running the notebook, the agent will prompt for input in the console.  Here are some example commands:

* `list all files`: Lists all files in the current directory.
* `read filename.txt`: Reads the content of `filename.txt`.
* `create documentation for file1.py, file2.txt`: Generates documentation for the specified files and saves them in the `docs` directory.
* `delete filename.txt`: Deletes `filename.txt`.
* `quit` or `exit`: Stops the agent.


## 4. Dependencies

* `dotenv`: For loading environment variables.
* `os`: For file system operations.
* `json`: For handling JSON data.
* `google.generativeai`: For interacting with the Google Gemini API.
* `datetime`: For timestamping documentation.


## 5. Notes and Important Details

* **API Key:**  The notebook requires a Google Gemini API key, which should be stored in a `.env` file in the same directory as the notebook.  The `.env` file should contain a line `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key`.
* **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling for file operations and API calls.  Error messages are returned to the user.
* **Memory Management:** The agent maintains a limited conversation history in `memory`.
* **Iteration Limit:** The `max_iterations` variable limits the number of user interactions.
* **Documentation Generation:** The quality of the generated documentation depends heavily on the prompt and the capabilities of the Gemini API.
* **Directory Creation:** The agent explicitly creates a "docs" directory to store generated documentation; this is a safety precaution in case the directory is missing.
* **Gemini Model:** The code specifies the "gemini-1.5-flash" model.  You might need to adjust this depending on the available models and your access.  Be aware that different models will have different capabilities and may require adjustments to prompts.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `file-management-ai-agent.ipynb` notebook.  Remember to install the necessary Python libraries before running the notebook.  If you encounter errors, carefully check the error messages and refer to the Google Gemini API documentation for troubleshooting guidance.
